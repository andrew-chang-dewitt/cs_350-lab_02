# Lab 2

An exercise in basic assembly programming completed for Illinois Institute of Technology's Fall 2024 CS 350, Computer Organization & Assembly Programming course.
Practiced assembly programming targeting a RISC-V instruction set using the [Venus RISC-V simulator](https://venus.cs61c.org/) by writing code to complete two simple tasks in assembly:

1. Print the sum of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to the nth term
2. Sum the values in an array containing a fixed number of elements & print the result

## Task 1: Fibonacci Sum

FIXME: finish this section

## Task 2: Array Sum
